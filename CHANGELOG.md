# Changelog

This file tracks the notable changes made to this project. It is meant for humans to read,
and is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

[Unreleased commits](https://github.com/polleverywhere/anybase/compare/v0.0.15...HEAD)

### Added

- This Changelog.
- A Code of Conduct for community contributions.
- Rubocop and the Poll Everywhere style rules.
- New gemspec metadata fields â€” especially the MFA requirement to submit to RubyGems.
- Modern gem defaults like "bin/consle".

### Changed

- Ownership to Poll Everywhere (per the conversation with the previous owner](https://github.com/joshbuddy/anybase/issues/6)).
- Use GitHub Actions instead of Travis to run CI tests.
- Updated RSpec.


### Fixed

- Passing `ignore_case: true` modified the digits string passed in at object creation. The
  code now makes a copy for its use so that user input isn't unexpectedly modified.

### Deprecated

- Support for Ruby series that are no longer maintained. (At the time of publication, that
  was any series older than Ruby 2.5.)

### Removed

- Support for Ruby 1.9.3. You must use Ruby 2.0 or higher.
